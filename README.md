# GDD-Lite
The games design document for my mobile game.

## OverView of the final game.
 The main basis of the game is a space themed endless runner.
 Using:
* [Phaser](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/)- for the game engine.
* [Matter.js](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/MatterJS.html)- for the physics engine 

The Unique selling point(usp)is a the sudo planet gravity as the player runs around a planet
### Interation 1
For interation 1 I'm going to try and get a fully working prototype of the endless runner working in the browser and mobile but only having the basic features of endless runner with
* timer
* automatic movement
* basic touch controls(single touch control
* points system


### Tech Architecture 
for the tech architecture i'll be using  phaser 3  and matter.js as the main platform as it allows me to  make lightweight functioning  games for the web and mobile devices. but may also use some plugins to enhance the gameplay.

### UI & UX
for the control scheme im think of just having a single touch control  with limit to no UI elements.
### Audio 
I don't think its neccesary  for the first interation to have audio or sound effects for the first version of the game.
### planning
Im going to be using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/fr0tffg4/mobile-game)  for planing and structure  of the project and it will allow me to split the task into seperate cards for each task. And  the ease of access with the team gantt plugin that converts the cards into a gantt chart.

### Testing
For testing im planning of using [Google forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/?utm_source=gaboutpage&utm_medium=formslink&utm_campaign=gabout) While  being more self lead in terms of testing of the game for any bugs or difficulty. 
I may use google analytics  for tracking on the game.
