# GDD-Lite
The games design document for my mobile game.

## OverView of the final game.
 The main basis of the game is a space themed endless runner.
 Using:
* [Phaser](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/)- for the game engine.
* [Matter.js](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/MatterJS.html)- for the physics engine 

The Unique selling point(usp)is a the sudo planet gravity as the player runs around a planet
### Interation 1
For interation 1 I'm going to try and get a fully working prototype of the endless runner working in the browser and mobile but only having the basic features of endless runner with
* timer
* automatic movement
* basic touch controls(single touch control
* points system
#### organisation
Im going to be using [Trello]()  for planing and structure  of the project and it will allow me to split the task into seperate cards for each task.
