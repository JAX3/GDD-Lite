The games design document for my mobile game.

##OverView of the final game.
 The main basis of the game is a space themed endless runner.
 Using:
*[Phaser](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/)- for the game engine.
*[Matter.js](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/MatterJS.html)- for the physics engine 

The Unique selling point(usp)is a the sudo planet gravity as the player runs around a planet
